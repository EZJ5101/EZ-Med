# Project Requirements
# EZ-Med Project
EZ Med Transport Co is an innovative app designed to revolutionize the medical transportation industry by catering to both human and veterinary medicine. Our mission is to provide a seamless, reliable, and efficient platform that connects patients and pet owners with a wide range of transportation options, tailored to their specific needs.

## Project Team Members
- Emerci Jones (Software Developer)

### The minimum project requirements are as follows:
- Front End Framework (React/Angular)
- Back End Framework (Node + Express/ASP.NET Core/Java Spring)
- Database (SQL or NoSQL, API)
- Styled with CSS
- Responsive
  
## **EZ-Med App Stretch Goals**
These stretch goals are NOT required, however, are goals we strive to reach after completing the project requirements.
  ### Stretch Goal 1:
  - Create a User Registration and Login (using Node, Express, My SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS) with JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users 
  ### Stretch Goal 1:
  - Deployed to a cloud server 
  
## Project Plan
A six-week project plan for developing the requirements will be added in 1 week sprints. These sprints will be tracked through a scrum process using a Trello Board and Google Docs, linked here below:

### Week 1: Development of Project Plan
- As a group, requirements have been gathered and continue to work to clarify any ambiguities.
- Goals, tasks, deliverables and deadlines are being discussed and defined to determine the project scope.
- Key tasks and milestones are being identified.
- A project schedule is being developed, with the first part of that being this week's timeline, to allocate resources and delegate tasks amongst our group of aspiring developers.
- A communication plan has been implemented which is comprised of: A Slack team DM, Final Project Group Slack Channel, Team Final Project GitHub, and Email.

### Week 2: Front End Development
- The front-end framework we will likely use is either React or Angular, based on project requirements.
- A development environment and project structure will be set up.
- A basic layout and components for the user interface will be created.
- Responsive design using CSS, and possibly SCSS. 
- Front-end code will be test and debugged to the best of ability in the 6 week time-frame, with the goal of continuing these processes beyond the project timeline (and post-graduation).

### Week 3: Back End Development
- Choose a back-end framework (Node + Express/ASP.NET Core/Java Spring) based on project requirements.
- Set up the development environment and project structure.
- Create server-side routes and API endpoints to handle client requests.
- Implement the necessary business logic and data validation.
- Integrate the chosen database (SQL or NoSQL) and design the data schema.
- Test and debug the back-end code.

### Week 4: Integration and Database Development
- Implement the chosen database (SQL or NoSQL) and set up the required tables/collections.
- Create necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for database interactions.
- Integrate the front-end and back-end components.
- Test and debug the integration between front-end and back-end.
- Implement any additional features required for the minimum project requirements.

### Week 5: Stretch Goals Implementation
- If the minimum project requirements are completed, start working on the stretch goals.
- Deploy the application to a cloud server (AWS, Azure, GCP) and configure necessary infrastructure.
- Integrate at least one external API (Google Maps, Github, Dropbox, etc.) into the project.
- Implement a Many-to-Many relationship in the database, if applicable.
- Create user registration and login functionality.
- Use JWT tokens for authentication and authorization of users.

### Week 6: Testing, Refinement, Documentation and
- Perform comprehensive testing of the entire application, including unit tests and integration tests.
- Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
- Optimize the application for performance and responsiveness.
- Create user documentation or developer documentation, as required.
- Prepare the application for deployment, ensuring all dependencies and configurations are properly documented.

Note: The duration of each week may vary based on the complexity of the project and available resources. Adjustments can be made to the timeline based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
